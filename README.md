# Chrome Extension Demo

Welcome to Dekel's Chrome extension demo! This demo will guide you through
making a fully functioning chrome extension, the purpose of which I haven't
decided at the time of making this file.

## Instructions

At every stage of this demo, you may look in a folder named "instructions" 
where I will save files named "stageXX.md" (where XX is a 2-digit number 
representing the current stage of the demo) and it will contain instructions 
and explanation on how to "advance" to the next stage of the demo.

The final commit will also include an "instructions.md" file which can be
viewed on [github.com](http://github.com/thedekel/wdchromeext/). When you
complete a stage, you may either use your code and the provided instructions
and continue to the next stage, or you may advance to the next stage by
checking-out the commit I tagged for that stage. For example, if you just
finished stage03, you may either continue following the stage04 instructions,
or you may use:

    $ git checkout stage04

which will update all the files to stage04.

## Start

to start this demo, either use

    $ git checkout stage01

or create a new folder somewhere on your computer and use the instructions
to create the extension within that folder.
